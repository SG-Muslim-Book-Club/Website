# Introduction

Hello and a warm welcome to SG Muslim Book Club! This is the official website for this project. 

We plan to make this Club work like an open-library built by the Singapore Muslim Community. This club will act a medium for us to lend out our books as well as borrow books from others. 

With this innitiative, now your books will not be collecting dust on the shelves anymore, along with that, now you don't have to spend hundreds on books that you are interested in reading. 

Inshallah this club will help to encourage muslims in Singapore to read more islamic literature and gain more knowledge about islam in the process.

Join this community and help spread islamic knowledge and gain islamic knowledge.

We will be using this [website](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_bAxLio17smPqfyaqn39NoETUFPvayQv8n0DblPVflM/edit?usp=sharing) for storing what books are available for borrowing and give away. Inshallah there you will find the one you are looking for.
